# Story

The Story element allows you to add instagram like stories into a GMetri experience. The story elements supports adding both image and video files.  
Each item inside a story is called a `Timeline` and can be added from the properties panel.

## Looks
The story element allows interactions like tap on right/left to goto next/previous timeline and tap and hold for pausing.

Each individual timeline can be configured with an image or video along with a text (optional) that appears on the bottom of the screen.

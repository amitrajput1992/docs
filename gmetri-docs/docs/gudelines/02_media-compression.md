## Image Compression

Compressed assets help your experiences load smoother and faster. It is good hygiene to compress your image assets before uploading them.

We recommend https://tinypng.com/ which compresses .png / .JPEG files with little to no loss in image quality.

#Video Compression
Videos need to be compressed before uploading them. The larger the file size, the longer it will take to load your experiences.  

Once you have exported your equirectangular videos, you may need to compress/resize your videos.

**We recommend** you use the Open Source tool [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php/) to do this. Here's how:

<iframe width={"100%"} height={"380px"}  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qv2JnZcf7BA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


**Alternatively, you can compress/resize content on the Adobe Suite**

If you are using Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe After Effects, directly compress and export the video from Adobe Media Encoder.

Here's a tutorial for this:

<iframe width={"100%"} height={"380px"}  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4b-jHxjdEWE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You could also use [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for this.

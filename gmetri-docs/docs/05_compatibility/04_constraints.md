# Constraints

There are certain limitation you should keep in mind while building a GMetri experience.

### 2D elements won't work in VR mode

If you are building primarily for a headset, then avoid using 2D HTML eleemnts like Actionbar, Quiz etc.

### Max Pano resolution should be capped at 4K for low-end devices

This also includes the Oculus Go. Go through [asset recommendations](./asset-recommendations) to get an idea of recommended asset resolution and size.
This needs to be verified while uploading the assets. You can find the size and resolution of assets on the right pane of the File Manager.

### Depth comes into play with VR mode

Placement of graphics is very important here. Things look very different in 2D and 3D.

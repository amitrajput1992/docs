# Viewer Groups

**Viewer Group** is a set of people allowed to see a deployment on the GMetri Platform. Every Deployment has a Viewer Group and anyone in an organization can create a Viewer Group. Several types of Viewer Groups can be created. 


## Create Viewer Groups

To create a viewer group (and to access all your viewer groups and their settings):
 
- Click on your avatar, then choose `Viewer Groups` from the menu.

The `Viewer Groups` viz. Public, Social and Editor are default Viewer Groups and cannot be removed or renamed.

- Click on `+ Viewer Group`. This will add a new entry to the `Viewer Group` section.
- Upon doing so, you can expand this entry to change its settings.

# 3D Models Conversion

The platform has 3D model support but works only with the lightweight web-based gtlf or glb version 2 formats.
 
Compatible Formats:

- 3MF
- AMF
- FBX
- OBJ and MTL
- GLTF and GLB version 1. Upload any .BIN, .FRAG, or .VERT files alongside your model (shader materials will export as grey).
- Collada ( DAE )
- Three.js JSON format.
- PCD (ASCII and Binary)
- PLY (ASCII and Binary)
- STL (ASCII and Binary)


Alternatively, here are the GMetri guidelines to directly export your models to the gltf/glb v2 format:

- from [3ds Max](./export-GLTF-from-3ds-max.md/)
- from [Blender](./export-GLTF-from-blender.md/)

Also, refer to the basic guidelines on [3D model](./3DModellingGuidelines.md/) creation.

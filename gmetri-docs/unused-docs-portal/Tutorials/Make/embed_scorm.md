# Embed a SCORM package in a GMetri experience

## Description

Once you create an [experience](../../../Features/Create/experiences/) on the GMetri platform, you can embed an external SCORM package inside the experience.

## Embed SCORM element

1. In your experience, add an `Embed SCORM` element.

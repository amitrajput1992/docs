# Experience Duplication

XR experiences created on GMetri can be duplicated for them to be re-purposed or modified.
Experinces can be duplicated within a workspace and also outside a workspace if you are a part of multiple workspaces.

## Duplication

1. **Duplication within a workspace**: Use the `Duplicate` option from the context menu of the expereince card on the experience listing page.
2. **Duplication outside a workspace**: Use the `Duplicate to` option from the context menu of the expereince card on the experience listing page.

    Upon clicking `Duplicate to` you'll be prompted to choose a workspace to duplicate an experience to.

## Export / Import

Any experince created on the GMetri platform can be exported using the `Export/Import` option in the experience settings menu under the `Advanced` section. This will download an `fv4` file which contains all the necessary metadata of an experience. Any exported `fv4` file can only be imported **within** a workspace.

:::caution CAUTION
`fv4` files exported before `11 January, 2020` will no longer work and cannot be used to import any experience. If you wish to import any such older `fv4` files to an experience, you must export the fv4 file again first.
